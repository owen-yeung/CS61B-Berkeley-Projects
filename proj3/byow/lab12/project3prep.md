# Project 3 Prep

**For tessellating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way.
After looking at your own implementation, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab.
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?**

Answer:

-----

**Can you think of an analogy between the process of tessellating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways?
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?**

Answer: Hexagons are just like rooms, and tesselation is connecting them via hallways.

-----
**If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tessellating hexagons.**

Answer: Room generation would be my first method, and then I would build other methods around that.

-----
**What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?**

Answer: They're both rectangular, but hallways are much narrower than rooms, and they can also branch or bend. 
Rooms have random height and length, while hallways only have random length.
