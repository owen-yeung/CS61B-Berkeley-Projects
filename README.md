My projects from UC Berkeley's Data Structures course CS61B, where I got an A+

See https://sp21.datastructur.es/ for course content and project specifications.

Most of this code has been provided by the course staff. We only had to complete a small number of key methods and classes. I've highlighted which code was completed by me below.

Brief details for each project:

# Project 0 (2048):

Implement the core game mechanic of 2048

See https://sp21.datastructur.es/materials/proj/proj0/proj0#your-assignment for details

**My contribution:** Completed the Model class (emptySpaceExists, maxTileExists, atLeastOneMoveExists and tilt methods)

# Project 1 (Double Ended Queue):

Implement the 'double ended queue' data structure twice, using linked lists and arrays as the underlying structure.

See https://sp21.datastructur.es/materials/proj/proj1/proj1#project-tasks for details

**My contribution:** Everything in {LinkedListDeque, ArrayDeque, MaxArrayDeque}.java, as well as completing the GuitarString class in the gh2 folder

# Project 2 (Mini Git):

Implement the basic features of Git

See https://sp21.datastructur.es/materials/proj/proj2/proj2#overview-of-gitlet for details

**My contribution:** Everything in {Commit, Main, MergeCommit, Repository}.java

# Project 3 (2D Game):

Design and implement a 2D tile-based world exploration game.

This project was co-developed with a partner.

See https://sp21.datastructur.es/materials/proj/proj3/proj3#overview for details

**My contribution:** Don't really remember exactly which parts I did, had a hand (along with partner) in most files in the 'Core' folder, other than ones that are authored by hug (the course instructor Josh Hug)
