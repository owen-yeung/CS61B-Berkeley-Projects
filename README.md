My projects from UC Berkeley's Data Structures course CS61B.

See https://sp21.datastructur.es/ for course content and project specifications.

Most of this code has been provided by the course staff. We only had to complete a small number of key methods and classes. I've highlighted which code was completed by me below.

Brief details for each project:

# Project 0 (2048):

Implement the core game mechanic of 2048

See https://sp21.datastructur.es/materials/proj/proj0/proj0#your-assignment for details

**My contribution:** Completed the Model class (emptySpaceExists, maxTileExists, atLeastOneMoveExists and tilt methods)

# Project 1 (Double Ended Queue):

Implement the 'double ended queue' data structure twice, using linked lists and arrays as the underlying structure.
